# pyrobokit
An Unofficial Python implementation of Seer Robokit NetProtocol for Seer SRC series controllers.

This library was developed with industrial application as a core focus. The library is still under developement and not all API's functions are implemented. The future roadmap for this library would be to implement all the API's functionality. The contributions are highly welcome.
